# How to run it!


Ensure that node and npm are installed on your machine.

Download the repository,
open a terminal in the main folder and run `npm i`
run `node server.js` (it should say listening on port 3000)
leave the terminal running (do not close it)

open a new terminal in the client folder
run `npm i` then run `npm run serve`
it will then display a local host port such as ("http://localhost:8081/").
Open the url in any browser and the project should be there.

Due to time contraints only the search function has been added.
